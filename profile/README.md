## :wave: Hi

Hello there! Welcome to **team nameless*** GitHub organization. 

We are a team with f--king big ambitions to create big things. Our range of stuffs are, including, but not limited to: Discord bot, games, GUI app, and moreover, we embrace **FOSS** - Free and Open Source Software.

Notable projects:
- [*nameless** Discord BOT](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot) - the bot written in Python 🐍 with batteries ⚡ in mind, currently powering our official Discord 💪.
- [*nameless** Discord theme](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-theme) - a red-tinted theme 🖼️ for BetterDiscord/Vencord/Vesktop users, plus the branding ✨.
- [And more...](https://github.com/orgs/team-nameless/repositories) - *perhaps checking the pins 📌 should be enough?*
