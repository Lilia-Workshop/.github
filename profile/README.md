## Hello there! 👋
Welcome to [**team nameless***](https://github.com/team-nameless).  We are a team with big ambitions to create big things 💪.

This place originally created to host the repository for [our Discord BOT](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot), but now a place to show the ones that we worked together 🌟. Solidarity working is always better than doing stuffs alone.

## So, what do you guys do in here 🤔?
We cook many kind of stuffs, I mean, *it's diverse as f\*ck.* Doing code alone is boring 😴. 

Please do not expect anything in here to be good 💩, but contributions are welcome 💖. Moreover, this is a **non-profit** place 💸, that means we only work for this place on ***whenever-we-are-free*** basis 🛌 (*"hobby"*). So don't expect active development and/or progress in here.

## ✨ Notable projects ✨ 
- [*nameless** Discord BOT](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot) - the Discord bot written in Python 🐍 with batteries ⚡ in mind, currently powering our Discord 💪.
- [*nameless** Discord theme](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-theme) - a red-focused theme 🖼️ for BetterDiscord/Vencord/Vesktop users, plus the branding ✨.
- [And more...](https://github.com/orgs/team-nameless/repositories) - *perhaps checking the pins 📌 should be enough?*
