## Hi there :wave:

Hello stranger!

We are the creators of [rewritten *nameless** Discord BOT](https://github.com/nameless-on-discord/nameless/) - a combination of [*horribly made Lilia*](https://github.com/Swyreee/Lilia) and [*original nameless**](https://github.com/FoxeiZ/nameless) - [the migration PR](https://github.com/nameless-on-discord/nameless/pull/2), and related projects. We work in this organization for free (free as in freedom of thoughts) - technically saying, we embrace **FOSS** - Free and Open Source Software. Most of the projects here complies with **GPLv3** license unless stated otherwise (BSD, MIT and such).

If you want to join this organization, feel free to send me (Swyrin#7193 on Discord) a DM why I should invite you.
> :handshake: Or if you don't use Discord, just send a PR here, I go to GitHub daily so be assured that you won't be missed out!

> :information_source: If you are a **Vietnamese** wanting to contribute to the organization, we have put a Discord link around here. Once you get in, grab the role access and head to the bottom of the server list, all channels related to Nameless are there.
