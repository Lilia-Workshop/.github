## Hi there :wave:

Hello stranger! Welcome to Team Nameless.

We are a team with a f--king ambition to create big things. Our range of stuffs are, including, but not limited to: Discord bot, games, GUI app, and more to be added! 

Notable projects:
- [*nameless** Discord BOT](https://github.com/nameless-on-discord/nameless/) - a combination of [*spaghetti-written Lilia*](https://github.com/Swyreee/Lilia) and [*original nameless**](https://github.com/FoxeiZ/nameless) - [the migration PR](https://github.com/nameless-on-discord/nameless/pull/2).

We work in this organization *for free* ("free" as in both "free beer" & "freedom of thoughts") - technically saying, we embrace **FOSS** - Free and Open Source Software.
